        <p>This is a popular classic massage and is an ideal intro for the uninitiated; it is the modality that comes to mind when most people think about massage, and it’s one of the best-known types of bodywork performed today.</p>
        <p>One of the primary goals of Swedish massage technique is to relax the entire body, which is achieved by rubbing the muscles with long gliding strokes - in the direction of blood returning to the heart, kneading and cross-fiber friction.</p>
        <p>Swedish massage, as well as most other massage types, is exceptionally beneficial for increasing the level of oxygen in the blood, decreasing muscle toxins, improving circulation and flexibility while easing tension. This will certainly leave you feeling relaxed, refreshed and revitalized.</p>

        <p>This massage treatment combines Swedish, shiatsu, and other techniques such as deep-tissue…</p>
        <p>This massage is particularly beneficial for anyone who is under immense emotional or physical stress - whether you are and athlete or not!</p>
        <p>It incorporates a variety of hands-on vigorous strokes and stretching – where applicable, and is a particularly effective treatment for the prevention and rehabilitation of injury, releasing muscular tension, as well as to restore balance to the musculo-skeletal system</p>
        <p>This massage treatment combines a variety of massage techniques used by professionals such as Osteopaths and Physiotherapists, that include Swedish, shiatsu and deep-tissue, to concentrate on the areas that are related to your sport. Athletes often get sports massages to prepare for peak performance, prevent injury, as well as to treat injury. </p>

    <div id="deep-tissue" class="white-popup mfp-hide">
        <p>This specific type of massage uses slow firm pressure that is designed to get at the heart of the matter…</p> 
        <p>Deep Tissue is a very specific massage treatment in which the therapist uses knuckles and elbow's to "strip out" muscle tissue as far down to the bone as possible by penetrating the deeper layers of muscle tissue, using slow firm pressure that is designed to get at the heart of the matter.</p>
        <p>Deep-tissue therapy is particularly beneficial in the release of chronic muscle tension and knots, to help break up scar tissue (only after complete healing from injury has occurred), as well as to increase circulation and detoxify the system.</p>
        <p>Despite being an intense massage treatment - which may not be to everyone’s taste, it is one of the most popular and sought after therapies today, and despite the intensity, this particular treatment will leave you feeling completely de-stressed.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="advanced-deep-tissue" class="white-popup mfp-hide">
        <p>Exactly the same as deep-tissue, only more focused and intense!</p>
        <p>Traditional massages are great when all you need is a little stress relief and relaxation. When you have knotted muscles, however, or have a more specific ailment, a more attentive technique is required.</p>
        <p>This is not for the faint hearted and only for those who enjoy good firm pressure. It’s the same as deep-tissue only more focused and intense! This technique allows the therapist to use slow focused deep pressure to treat specific problems, it’s particularly effective in the elimination and break-up of scar tissue, and is ideal for anyone suffering from tight overused muscles.</p>
        <p>As with most remedial massage techniques, this is not designed to make you feel relaxed during the treatment and may well leave you feeling sore after (but this clears up quickly to leave you feeling much lighter than before), however, being one the most precise and methodical treatments available, it has gained popularity with the general public in recent years, because of the very real therapeutic effect it has in treating a host of specific problems, the most prevalent being back and shoulder pain, and is regarded as one of the most therapeutic of all massage treatments.</p>
