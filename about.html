        <h1>Who we are</h1>
        <div class="main-content">
            <p>We are a team of professional massage therapists, specializing in mobile massage therapy throughout central London and surrounding areas.   </p>
            <p>Each member of our team has been selected exclusively for their multidisciplinary approach to massage, allowing them to draw from a much wider range of techniques, that not only gives them the edge over their contemporaries, but also puts them at the forefront in providing the next generation in massage therapy.</p>
            <p>We work with some of London's Top 5 star Hotels* and Spa's, and offer bespoke massage treatments to both private residents and visitors alike, and because we are mobile, we will come at a time and place that is convenient for you.</p>
        </div> 
        <h2>Our Philosophy</h2> 
        <div class="main-content">
            <p>Quite simply, we believe in pushing the boundaries of the conventional to deliver the very best in therapeutic care, to help combat all muscular aches and pains â€“ sports related or otherwise, which will leave you feeling relaxed, refreshed and revitalized.</p>
            <p>Our professional team of therapists are qualified in multiple disciplines, this means you no longer have to settle for the one-dimensional approach to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Insomnia related to stress</li>
                <li>Myofascial pain syndrome</li>
                <li>Soft tissue strains or injuries</li>
                <li>Sports injuries</li>
                <li>Temporomandibular joint pain</li>
                <li>Increased circulation</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Beyond the benefits for specific conditions or diseases, some people enjoy massage because it often releases endorphins that can produce feelings of caring, comfort and connection, and happiness.</p>
            <p>Massage is first and foremost complimentary to regular medical care and not intended as a replacement; however, studies have indicated the effectiveness in promoting good heath and wellbeing when worked in tandem with conventional medicine, and you should always discuss fully what it is you are hoping to achieve with your therapist, so that they can advise on the right course of action to take.</p>
